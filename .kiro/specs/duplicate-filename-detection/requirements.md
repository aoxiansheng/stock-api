# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing duplicate analysis script to detect and report duplicate file names across the project. Currently, the script analyzes duplicate constants, enums, DTOs, and types, but doesn't check for files with the same name in different directories, which can cause confusion and potential import conflicts.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to detect duplicate file names across different directories, so that I can identify potential naming conflicts and confusion points in the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the duplicate analysis script runs THEN it SHALL scan all TypeScript files for duplicate base names
2. WHEN duplicate file names are found THEN they SHALL be grouped by base name (excluding path and extension)
3. WHEN generating the report THEN duplicate file names SHALL be displayed with their full paths and directories
4. WHEN files have the same base name THEN the system SHALL report them as potential conflicts

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see file name duplicates organized by severity, so that I can prioritize which conflicts to address first.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN duplicate file names are detected THEN they SHALL be categorized by conflict type
2. WHEN files are in the same module/feature directory THEN they SHALL be marked as high-priority conflicts
3. WHEN files are in different modules THEN they SHALL be marked as medium-priority conflicts
4. WHEN files have different purposes (e.g., .spec.ts vs .ts) THEN they SHALL be marked as low-priority or excluded

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see additional metadata for duplicate files, so that I can make informed decisions about renaming or consolidation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN duplicate files are reported THEN each file SHALL include file size information
2. WHEN duplicate files are reported THEN each file SHALL include last modified date
3. WHEN duplicate files are reported THEN each file SHALL include the directory structure context
4. WHEN generating the report THEN files SHALL be sorted by modification date within each duplicate group

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the file name duplicate detection to integrate seamlessly with the existing analysis report, so that I have a comprehensive view of all naming conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the analysis runs THEN file name duplicates SHALL be included in the same report as other duplicates
2. WHEN the report is generated THEN file name duplicates SHALL have their own section in the markdown output
3. WHEN displaying statistics THEN the summary SHALL include counts of duplicate file names
4. WHEN the analysis completes THEN console output SHALL include file name duplicate statistics
