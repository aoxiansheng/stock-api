# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The dual-track rate limiting system provides layered protection against excessive API requests through both IP-level and API Key-level rate limiting mechanisms. This document outlines the requirements for enhancing the existing system to improve its configurability, monitoring, and resilience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure rate limits through a centralized configuration system, so that I can easily adjust limits based on system load and usage patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts up THEN it SHALL load rate limit configurations from environment variables, configuration files, and database settings.
2. WHEN a configuration parameter is specified in multiple sources THEN the system SHALL follow a clear precedence order (environment variables > configuration files > database > defaults).
3. WHEN configuration changes are made at runtime THEN the system SHALL apply them without requiring a restart.
4. WHEN rate limit configurations are loaded THEN the system SHALL validate them against defined constraints (min/max values, format requirements).
5. WHEN invalid configurations are detected THEN the system SHALL log warnings and fall back to safe default values.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want detailed metrics and monitoring for rate limiting events, so that I can identify patterns, optimize configurations, and detect abuse.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rate limits are enforced THEN the system SHALL emit standardized metrics for monitoring systems.
2. WHEN rate limits are approached (e.g., 80% of limit) THEN the system SHALL generate early warning events.
3. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL log detailed information including client identifier, endpoint, and historical request patterns.
4. WHEN the system is running THEN it SHALL provide real-time statistics on rate limit usage through a monitoring endpoint.
5. WHEN rate limit events occur THEN the system SHALL categorize them by type (IP-level vs API Key-level) and severity.
6. WHEN suspicious patterns are detected (e.g., distributed attacks) THEN the system SHALL generate security alerts.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want clear feedback when I approach or exceed rate limits, so that I can adjust my request patterns and avoid disruptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client makes a request THEN the system SHALL include standardized rate limit headers in the response.
2. WHEN a client exceeds rate limits THEN the system SHALL return a 429 response with detailed information about the limit, current usage, and reset time.
3. WHEN a client is about to exceed rate limits (e.g., 80% of limit) THEN the system SHALL include a warning header in the response.
4. WHEN rate limits differ by endpoint or method THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which limit was applied.
5. WHEN multiple rate limits apply (IP and API Key) THEN the system SHALL include information about both in the response.

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want the rate limiting system to be resilient to failures, so that core API functionality remains available even when rate limiting components fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Redis service is unavailable THEN the API Key rate limiting SHALL fall back to a degraded mode that allows requests to proceed.
2. WHEN the in-memory store for IP-based limiting becomes corrupted THEN the system SHALL reset and continue functioning.
3. WHEN rate limiting middleware encounters an unexpected error THEN it SHALL log the error and allow the request to proceed rather than causing a service outage.
4. WHEN the system operates in degraded mode THEN it SHALL emit alerts and attempt to recover normal operation.
5. WHEN the system recovers from a failure THEN it SHALL log the recovery event and resume normal rate limiting.

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security officer, I want advanced protection against rate limit bypass attempts, so that the system remains secure against sophisticated attacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client attempts to bypass IP-based rate limiting through header manipulation THEN the system SHALL detect and block such attempts.
2. WHEN multiple API Keys are used in a coordinated fashion from the same source THEN the system SHALL detect and flag this pattern.
3. WHEN a client rapidly cycles through different API Keys THEN the system SHALL implement additional restrictions.
4. WHEN distributed denial-of-service patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL activate enhanced protection measures.
5. WHEN the system detects repeated rate limit violations THEN it SHALL implement progressive penalties (longer blocks, stricter limits).
6. WHEN bypass attempts are detected THEN the system SHALL log detailed forensic information for later analysis.
