# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the critical code quality issue where types and enums are being mixed throughout the codebase, specifically focusing on resolving conflicts where the same identifiers (like `OperationStatus` and `BLOCKED`) are defined in both type definitions and enum definitions. This creates inconsistencies, potential runtime errors, and maintenance difficulties. The solution will establish a unified approach to using either types or enums consistently across the codebase.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent type definitions across the codebase, so that I can avoid confusion and potential runtime errors when working with status values and operation states.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the codebase THEN the system SHALL identify all instances where the same identifier exists in both type and enum definitions
2. WHEN a conflict is detected THEN the system SHALL prioritize enum definitions over type definitions for consistency
3. WHEN resolving conflicts THEN the system SHALL ensure all imports and usages are updated to reference the unified definition
4. WHEN the resolution is complete THEN there SHALL be no duplicate identifiers between types and enums

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a standardized approach to operation status handling, so that all modules use the same status values and avoid inconsistencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining operation statuses THEN the system SHALL use a single, centralized enum definition
2. WHEN modules need operation status values THEN they SHALL import from the centralized enum
3. WHEN status values are used THEN they SHALL be type-safe and consistent across all modules
4. WHEN new status values are needed THEN they SHALL be added to the centralized enum only

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear separation between types and enums, so that I can understand when to use each approach and maintain code consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining constant values THEN enums SHALL be used for discrete, finite sets of related values
2. WHEN defining shape contracts THEN types SHALL be used for object structures and complex type definitions
3. WHEN values need runtime representation THEN enums SHALL be preferred over const assertions
4. WHEN type checking is the primary concern THEN union types derived from enums SHALL be used

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated detection of type/enum conflicts, so that future conflicts can be prevented during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is committed THEN the system SHALL automatically detect type/enum identifier conflicts
2. WHEN conflicts are found THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating the conflicting files and lines
3. WHEN conflicts exist THEN the build process SHALL fail until conflicts are resolved
4. WHEN new identifiers are added THEN they SHALL be validated against existing types and enums

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want migration guidance for existing code, so that I can safely update my modules to use the new unified approach.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating existing code THEN clear documentation SHALL be provided for the migration process
2. WHEN updating imports THEN the system SHALL provide automated refactoring suggestions
3. WHEN breaking changes occur THEN they SHALL be clearly documented with migration examples
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all existing functionality SHALL remain intact
