# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will analyze the codebase to identify duplicate constants, variables, and DTO exports across different files, particularly in constants files, enums, and DTOs. The goal is to create a comprehensive report that highlights naming conflicts and potential consolidation opportunities to improve code maintainability and prevent confusion.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify duplicate constant names across different constant files, so that I can consolidate or rename them to avoid confusion and maintain consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the analysis runs THEN the system SHALL scan all files in the constants directories across all modules
2. WHEN duplicate constant names are found THEN the system SHALL record the constant name, file paths, and values
3. WHEN constants have the same name but different values THEN the system SHALL flag them as potential conflicts
4. WHEN constants have the same name and same values THEN the system SHALL flag them as consolidation candidates

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify duplicate variable names in enum files, so that I can ensure enum values are unique and properly organized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the analysis runs THEN the system SHALL scan all enum files across all modules
2. WHEN duplicate enum value names are found across different enums THEN the system SHALL record the enum name, value name, file paths, and actual values
3. WHEN enum values have the same name but different underlying values THEN the system SHALL flag them as potential conflicts
4. WHEN enum values have the same name and same underlying values THEN the system SHALL flag them as consolidation candidates

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify duplicate export names in DTO files, so that I can resolve naming conflicts and improve code clarity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the analysis runs THEN the system SHALL scan all DTO files across all modules
2. WHEN duplicate DTO class names or interface names are found THEN the system SHALL record the export name, file paths, and type information
3. WHEN DTOs have the same name but different structures THEN the system SHALL flag them as potential conflicts
4. WHEN DTOs have the same name and similar structures THEN the system SHALL flag them as consolidation candidates

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a comprehensive report of all duplicate identifiers, so that I can prioritize which duplicates to address first.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the analysis completes THEN the system SHALL generate a structured report in markdown format
2. WHEN generating the report THEN the system SHALL categorize duplicates by type (constants, enums, DTOs)
3. WHEN generating the report THEN the system SHALL include severity levels (conflict vs consolidation opportunity)
4. WHEN generating the report THEN the system SHALL provide file paths and line numbers for each duplicate
5. WHEN generating the report THEN the system SHALL include recommendations for resolution

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the analysis to be configurable, so that I can focus on specific types of duplicates or exclude certain directories.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the analysis THEN the system SHALL support filtering by file type (constants, enums, DTOs)
2. WHEN running the analysis THEN the system SHALL support excluding specific directories or files
3. WHEN running the analysis THEN the system SHALL support case-sensitive and case-insensitive comparison modes
4. IF no configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL use sensible defaults to scan the entire src directory
