/**
 * Symbol Mapper Cache Error Codes
 *
 * NOTE: All specific error codes have been removed as they were unused.
 * If needed in the future, consider using standardized error codes from the common error handling system
 * or implement cross-module error code standardization as mentioned in the analysis report.
 *
 * For reference, similar error patterns exist in other modules that could be standardized:
 * - MEMORY_PRESSURE: Found in 12+ modules with 15+ variants
 * - INVALID_PROVIDER_FORMAT: Found in 3 modules with 3 variants
 * - DATABASE_CONNECTION_FAILED: Found in 5+ modules with 8+ variants
